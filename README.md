   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd meet-landing-page
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the landing page.

## Responsive Design

The layout adapts based on screen width using media queries:

- **Desktop (1024px and above)**: Full layout with all elements visible.
- **Tablet (768px - 1023px)**: Adjusted layout for better readability.
- **Mobile (480px - 767px)**: Two images per row in the info section, optimized font sizes, and spacing.

## Challenges Faced

- **Hero Image Scaling Issue**: The hero image was larger than 100%, causing layout shifts. This was fixed by restricting its width.
- **Mobile Layout Adjustments**: On screens smaller than 480px, the `.info__content` images were stacked in a single column instead of two per row. Media queries were used to fix this.
